## Lessons Learned

Learned about Intent, Toast, imageView, videoView, Relative Layout.

Firstly my textView was chaning in different phones(screens with different Aspect Ratio).
Then I've learned about (android:gravity="center"), which fixed the error. Now the textView is properly visible in every kind of phone screens.
